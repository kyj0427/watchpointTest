    question: "Things to keep in mind",
    answer: `
      When using our services, it’s essential to be well-informed to ensure a smooth experience. 
      Start by reviewing the terms and conditions associated with the service you are purchasing. 
      This helps avoid any misunderstandings or unexpected surprises. Communication with the 
      service provider is crucial; it ensures clarity on details like timelines, expectations, 
      and deliverables. Additionally, be mindful of deadlines or any time-sensitive aspects of 
      the service, as delays can sometimes affect the outcome. It’s always a good idea to 
      double-check all details before proceeding to ensure everything aligns with your needs.
    `,
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    question: "Payment Policy",
    answer: `
      We require payment to be made in advance to secure any service. This ensures that both 
      the service provider and client are committed to the agreement. Rest assured that all 
      payments are processed through a secure payment system to protect your financial 
      information. Once your payment is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation receipt as 
      proof of the transaction.
    `,
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "Cancellation Policy",
    answer: `
      We understand that plans can change, so we offer a flexible cancellation policy. If you 
      need to cancel a service, it’s best to do so before the service starts or before 
      significant progress has been made. For cancellations made within the appropriate notice 
      period, you may be eligible for a full refund. However, cancellations made at the last 
      minute or after substantial resources have been allocated may incur a cancellation fee.
    `,
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "Refund Policy",
    answer: `
      Your satisfaction is important to us, which is why we offer a fair and transparent refund 
      policy. If the service provider is unable to deliver the agreed-upon service or if a 
      justified cancellation is made, you will be eligible for a refund. Refunds are typically 
      processed within 5–7 business days after approval, though this timeline may vary slightly 
      depending on your payment method.
